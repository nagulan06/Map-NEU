## Map-NEU
The vertices in the graph are the buildings in the campus map, the edges represent the path between them and the weights in the edges are the distance between the buildings measured in Feet. The weights are the straight line distance measured using google maps. Dijkstra algorithm is employed to find the shortest path between any two vertices (buildings)
